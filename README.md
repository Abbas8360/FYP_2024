ABSTRACT

IoT Based Smart Helmet

 The IoT-based smart helmet is an innovative safety solution for hazardous environments like construction sites, mines, and industrial areas. It integrates advanced sensors and IoT technology for real-time monitoring of environmental conditions and user safety. Key features include sensors for detecting hazardous gases, temperature, and humidity, as well as an accelerometer and gyroscope for monitoring head impacts and falls. Equipped with GPS and communication modules, the helmet provides real-time alerts and data transmission to a centralized monitoring system, enabling immediate response to accidents. This system improves safety standards and emergency response times while collecting valuable data to enhance workplace safety protocols and preventive measures. The IoT-based smart helmet represents a significant advancement in personal protective equipment, leveraging IoT technology to create safer working environments.
